			<h2>About this project</h2>
			<p>
				Imag(in)ing Rochester is a multimedia project that challenges people to interact with their
				environment in unique and unconventional ways. This project specifically addresses the
				city of Rochester and Rochester Institute of Technology as sites of complex structures of
				relationships between people, place, politics, and visual encounters.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our goal is twofold: 1) to critically examine the sites, spaces, and experiences of
				environments that come pre-packaged to our perception, and 2) to empower individuals and
				communities to form their own experiences, images, and maps.
			</p>
			<p>
				This project began when we found ourselves deeply moved by what we were learning in the
				classroom. Unlike the traditional world of Academia, which often came delivered to us in
				a dry and irrelevant manner, this theory seemed to contain within it a radical call to action.
				It summoned us to rethink our lives and the way that we experience, navigate, and interact
				with our environments. We wholeheartedly embrace taking theory to and deriving it from the
				streets.
			</p>
			<p>
				We’re a collective of individuals stemming from many disciplines——as varied as
				Information Technology, Game Design, Visual Culture, Fine Art, Sociology, and Gender
				Studies——within the RIT community.
			</p>
			<p>
				This project grew (and continues to grow) from the fertile soil of City-As-Text-based
				pedagogy and models of interactive and experiential learning. Walker Percy’s “Loss of the
				Creature” (1975), Frederick Turner’s “Cultivating the American Garden: Towards a Secular
				View of Nature” (1985), and Michel DeCerteau’s “Walking in the City” (1985) form the
				primary building blocks of our manifesto.
			</p>
			<p>
				This continually evolving project seeks to create a collection of provocative objects
				embodied online, in print, and through events. But this is just the beginning. YOU ARE THE
				NEXT ITERATION OF THIS PROJECT.
			</p>
