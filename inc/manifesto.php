				<h2>Our Manifesto</h2>
				<p>
					Our interactions with place are highly complex, formed by our personal histories and layers of politics, cultural norms, and deep-seated generational belief systems. Add to that an increasingly digital/virtual world, in which our devices both facilitate and inhibit our capacity for interaction——We are never really interacting with a “pure” environment and having “untouched” experiences. How we move through a given environment is guided by structures. These structures are physical——sidewalks, bike paths, roads——and intangible——socio-economic, ethnic, gender-specific. We are further mediated by maps and images, all of which follow specific agendas. We are in constant negotiation between formal and informal structures of power, but we form habits, we carry rhythms on our tongues and in our footsteps.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our goal is to unravel these patterns, to deconstruct these layers, and become critically aware of their presence in shaping our experiences. To empower individuals and communities, to reawaken a sense of wonder and play, to creatively upset boundaries and hierarchies, we will deliberately form our own paths, maps, and images. Our resistance may be quiet or it may be loud and reverberate in the streets. We will seek fresh ways to build connections and engage in unconventional interactions.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is only a provocation. The rest is up to you.
